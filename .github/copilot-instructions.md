# Data Recovery Tool - Development Instructions

## Project Overview
Production-level deleted data recovery tool implemented in VB.NET with intermediate capabilities:
- Raw disk sector reading and analysis
- File signature detection and parsing
- NTFS/FAT32 file system structure analysis
- Fragmented file reconstruction
- Multi-threaded recovery operations

## Architecture
- **DataRecoveryCore.dll**: Core library with low-level disk operations
- **RecoveryConsole.exe**: Command-line interface for testing and automation
- **Future GUI**: Windows Forms/WPF interface (Phase 2)

## Development Standards
- Production-level error handling and logging
- Comprehensive unit testing
- Administrator privilege validation
- Memory-efficient large file processing
- Async/await patterns for I/O operations
- Proper resource disposal and cleanup

## Implementation Phases
✅ Phase 1a: Project structure and Git setup
⏳ Phase 1b: Core DLL library with disk access
⏳ Phase 1c: File signature analysis engine
⏳ Phase 1d: NTFS/FAT32 parsers
⏳ Phase 1e: Console application interface
⏳ Phase 1f: Integration testing and optimization
