# Intermediate Data Recovery Tool

A production-level deleted data recovery tool built with VB.NET, featuring intermediate capabilities for raw disk analysis, file signature detection, and file system parsing.

## Features

### Core Capabilities
- **Raw Disk Access**: Direct sector-level reading with administrator privileges
- **File Signature Analysis**: Detect files by header/footer patterns even without file system metadata
- **Multi-File System Support**: NTFS, FAT32, and exFAT parsing capabilities
- **Fragmented Recovery**: Reconstruct files scattered across disk sectors
- **Performance Optimized**: Async operations with memory-efficient processing
